# 1
The procedure p is applied 5 times.

# 2
We have:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
(sine \, a) &=& (p \, (sine \, \frac{a}{3})) \\
&=& (p \, (p \, (sine \frac{a}{3^2}))) \\
&=& (p \, (p \, (p \, (sine \frac{a}{3^3})))) \\
&=& ... \\
&=& (p \, (p \, (p \, ... \, (sine \frac{a}{3^n}))))
\end{eqnarray}
$$

The innermost procedure stops when $(abs \, \frac{a}{3^n}) \leq 0.1$. So we have $n \geq \log_3{10a}$. Thus the order of growth in number of steps is $O(\lg{a})$. 

Since each node in the recursive tree only has one child, thus the order of growth in space is also $O(\lg{a})$.
